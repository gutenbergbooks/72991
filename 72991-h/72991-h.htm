<p class="center fs110">WEST INDIA PARTY DISINGENUOUSLY TREATED.</p>

<p class="p2 noindent">The West India Question is gradually narrowing
to a point. There seems now to be little difference
of opinion in regard to all safe and practicable
measures tending to ameliorate the condition of the
slaves, though the time and manner of their adoption
may be dependent upon local considerations.</p>

<p>The question of emancipation, or that measure
commonly designated Compulsory Manumission,
alone remains at issue. The paramount importance
of this clause, and the alarm felt in every
West India colony at the threat of government to
enforce its adoption, has caused the proceedings of
the colonial department to be closely scrutinized,
and it has in a variety of publications been charged
with precipitation.</p>

<p>A pamphlet has lately appeared in vindication,
under the title of “Remarks on an Address to the
Members of the New Parliament, on the Proceedings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
of the Colonial Department with respect
to the West India Question.” It is avowedly
“written by a Member of the late Parliament,”
and bears internal evidence of being the production
of a gentleman connected with the Colonial Office.</p>

<p>This pamphlet calls for a reply, for two reasons:
First, because the writer indulges in recrimination,
and brings accusations against the West India
body, which, if passed unnoticed, might produce a
very erroneous impression on the minds of the moderate
and disinterested portion of the legislature.</p>

<p>Secondly, because the writer discusses the compulsory
manumission clause, and acquaints us with
the nature and strength of the reasoning employed
by government to justify the adoption of that
measure.</p>

<p>The general tone of the publication will create
much surprise, and in one respect it will be of service,
in making known the true relations and influence
of the contending parties. It has been
asserted by the anti-colonial advocates, and believed
by a large portion of the community, that
the West Indians possessed great influence with
government, by means of which their cause was
powerfully strengthened.</p>

<p>If the well-informed portion of the public could
once have entertained this belief, their error must
appear manifest on a perusal of the pamphlet in
question. The writer expresses himself very unceremoniously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
towards those of the West India
body, who were members of the last parliament;
and his tone might lead one to conclude that he
thinks them not worth conciliation. He seems
to justify his asperity, by complaining that the
colonial department is improperly singled out for
attack in regard to those proceedings which the
colonial interests do not approve. Now he must
be aware that, constitutionally speaking, <em>responsibility</em>
peculiarly attaches to that officer of the
crown from whose department particular acts <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: ema nate">emanate</ins>.
If important measures affecting the colonies
are carried into effect, while there is reason to
believe that the Secretary of State for that department
is in possession of despatches, official reports,
or other information showing their inexpediency,
he will be chiefly looked to for the consequences;
because it is conceived to be his
immediate duty to give full explanation of the
details, both to his colleagues and to parliament,
and not to incur responsibility for measures he could
not conscientiously approve. These are rather the
sentiments of the British nation than of any individual
party.</p>

<p>It cannot, therefore, be invidious to canvass
freely the acts of that particular department. It is
the obvious and the regular course where grievances
are felt; and all our ideas of public principle warrant
a belief, that when such grievances are fairly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
stated, every officer of the crown to whose department
they referred, so far from feeling indignant at
their exposition, would be anxious to extend his
protection, in order to have them promptly redressed.</p>

<p>Thus viewing the case, our advocate of the
colonial department cannot mistake the tendency or
application of any of the comments contained in
this publication; and he will be aware that a fair
spirit of argument alone influences an examination
of his positions, and of the judgment evinced in the
manner and tone with which he has maintained
them.</p>

<p>This writer endeavours to defend government,
by charging the West Indians with inconsistency.
This mode of argument, so frequently resorted
to in political warfare, in nine cases out of ten
indicates a feeble cause. It can surely never be
too late to correct a principle radically wrong.</p>

<p>But let us examine the charge.</p>

<p>It is contended, that compulsory manumission
was clearly laid down in the proceedings of parliament
in March, 1824; that it was heard by the West
India members without opposition, which was an
implied acquiescence; and that if they now turn
round to oppose it, they must have been “the most
ignorant, incautious, and imbecile body of men
who ever were got together to represent an interest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<p>It was well known to the writer of this sentence,
that the West India members were unanimously
opposed to compulsory manumission; and it may
be added, that a charge, couched in such language
as this, could not have been expected from such a
quarter. It may be true, that the West India members
did not appeal to the House so early or so often
as the threatened injustice may have demanded.
But is this difficult to account for? When West
India members have come forward to state their
case, have we not seen it retorted upon them in the
widely-disseminated publications of the anti-colonial
party, in terms of the utmost coarseness: “He is
a slave-driver: what attention or confidence is due
to the statement of such a character?”</p>

<p>The West India members are indeed in a
dilemma: if they speak, they run the risk of being
abused—if silent, they are to be held parties to all
the acts of precipitation and folly which may take
place in colonial government.</p>

<p>It would be unnecessary to touch upon this point,
did not one remark pre-eminently suggest itself for
grave consideration. Throughout this pamphlet
we have the defending of parties, clashing of interests,
and such terms; just as if the “Saints”
and the West Indians were to fight the battle betwixt
them, and whichever proved the most cunning,
or the most persevering, would carry their point.
And is this the language an apologist of government
thinks it necessary to maintain? Can he have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
forgotten the grounds on which the West Indians
were induced to commit their cause to the care of
government? It was to stop useless or violent discussion.
It proceeded from the principle, that if
one party declaimed about alleged oppression of
the negroes, and the other about their property, the
safety of the colonies was the immediate province
of ministers; that, as public servants, it was their
sacred duty to uphold all the possessions of the
crown; and that, in watching over their welfare,
they equally protected the property of the colonists.</p>

<p>Though this consideration influenced the conduct
of many West India members, still it is very erroneous
to assert, that no explicit opposition was made
to compulsory manumission at the very outset. It
is asserted that it passed without animadversion,
“<em>except in a speech</em> of the present Lord Seaford (Mr.
C. R. Ellis), made on the day on which Mr.
Canning uttered his celebrated commentary on
its enactments.” One would think that dissent
could not well be more clearly avowed than from
the lips of the Chairman of the West India body.
In point of fact, sufficient opposition, consistently
with the respect which was shown to government,
was evinced, to prove that the measure of compulsory
manumission was from first to last peculiarly
condemned by the colonial interests. When Mr.
Canning first made known the intentions of government
on this point, Lord Seaford explicitly denied
being a party to them. When Mr. Brougham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
brought forward his last motion on the same subject,
Lord Seaford again gave his reasons for resisting
the measure. To those reasons, not a syllable
in refutation was offered by Mr. Canning.</p>

<p>Besides these declarations of the chairman, every
West India petition presented either to the king, to
parliament, or to the Colonial office, explicitly set
forth similar sentiments. The agents for the colonies,
the merchants and mortgagees, early felt
alarm; and in a petition from these last, presented
on the 26th April, 1826, to the Lords
by Lord Redesdale, and to the Commons by Mr.
Baring, it was stated, “That until it shall be
proved, that free negroes will work for hire, the
process of compulsory emancipation cannot even
be experimentally commenced, upon a West
India estate, with justice to the various parties
holding legal claims upon the property.”</p>

<p>Surely nothing could be more explicit than this,
to convey the opinion of the parties most deeply interested
in the question. But the hardy assertion
of the writer we have quoted, calls for still further
explanation. This writer must know, that in every
interview or communication with the Colonial office,
those of the West India body, to whose opinions
most weight was likely to be attached, were loud
and strenuous in their entreaties for forbearance.
They stated, that the government had not given
sufficient examination to the case; that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
ignorant of many important local circumstances
that those ought all first to be carefully and fully
investigated before a measure of vital importance
was enforced; and that, in short, the government
were already getting into difficulties, and if they
proceeded further they would get more deeply involved,
and might find it unpleasant, if not impossible,
to extricate themselves.</p>

<p>To attempt, therefore, to criminate the West
India party, if opposition be now manifested, is not
consistent with that impartiality which we have a
right to expect from a member of the legislature;
still less does it indicate the manly candour presumed
to influence the conduct of an officer of His
Majesty’s government.</p>

<p>It is argued, again, that a general declaration of
dissent was not sufficient. The Order in Council
for Trinidad contained four clauses, showing how
compulsory manumission was to be carried into execution.
That Order was uniformly described as
the model for the rest of the colonies; and it was the
duty of the West India party, in their subsequent
proceedings, to move for the rescission of those
clauses, if they entertained objections to them as a
model.</p>

<p>Two reasons may be assigned why the colonists
deemed it unnecessary to express their disapproval
of the Trinidad order. First, the tenure on which
property was held in the British colonies differed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
from that of the Spanish colony of Trinidad. Secondly,
it was notorious, that various portions of
that order had to be repeatedly sent home for explanation
and remodelling. Was there, then, fair
reason to believe, that every clause contained in the
original order would be enforced upon the other
colonies, while it was yet doubtful if they would be
finally confirmed even in the colony for which the
order had been originally framed?</p>

<p>Time was afforded the government for reflection.
It was presumed, that they would learn, by experience,
the difficulty occasioned by legislating
precipitately for distant settlements. This line of
conduct was dictated by respect for the government.
Had the West India body in England
come forward in a bolder manner than they had
done to resist the determination avowed by the
Colonial Secretary of State, how would they have
been met? They would have been told by the
very same parties who are now wilfully misinterpreting
their quiescence—“You are exciting the
colonial assemblies to needless opposition—your
violence will engender contumacy in its worst form—remain
silent till you know what is their decision.”</p>

<p>Such reflections undoubtedly did actuate them;
but now, when opposition to compulsory manumission
is known to be unanimous throughout the
colonies which possess legislatures, the West India<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
body in England, since repeated warnings and
admonitions have been vain, do but consistently
follow them up by appealing in a determined
manner to parliament, and to the British nation,
against the threatened intentions of government
to enforce its enactment.</p>

<p>All the apologists of the measure seem, in their
very tone, to be aware of the great degree of responsibility
to be incurred in carrying it into
effect; and hence there is a laboured attempt to
show, that it is strictly conformable with the first
proceedings of parliament, and with the resolutions
of 1823. The West Indians are told, “in addition
to your ignorance and imbecility, there will be the
charge of shameful inconsistency to bring against
you, if you now oppose our measures. You concurred
unanimously in Mr. Canning’s resolutions;
compulsory manumission is distinctly contemplated
by those resolutions; and can you now propose to
retract the assent given to them by your former
votes.”</p>

<p>The West India members had little right to
expect that such an accusation would ever be
brought against them. In every stage of the proceedings,
the whisper was incessantly reiterated
in the ear of His Majesty’s ministers—“Adhere
honestly to your own resolutions—for the sake of
justice we call upon you, not to court a vulgar
and transient popularity at our expense!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p>And why was it that the resolutions were thus
implicitly relied on? Not from any opinion that
declarations of separate branches of the legislature
could affect the rights of individuals resting on the
statute-laws of the realm, but, because the parliamentary
resolution contained a principle of
cautious and practical legislation, and authorised
the belief that, at each stage of procedure, careful
examination and scrutiny would precede the adoption
of measures which could be alleged, by any
party concerned, to infringe their rights or interests.</p>

<p>When, subsequently, statements were made in
the House of Commons, that government was departing
from this principle, in enforcing compulsory
manumission, neither Mr. Canning, nor Mr. Wilmot
Horton, thought proper openly to attempt an explicit
refutation.</p>

<p>What is the commentary? Matters are now
becoming more critical, and the Executive resort
to the plea of acting only upon the declared will of
the legislature in their justification. Let us give
them every advantage. Let us discuss the propriety
of compulsory manumission, as it agrees
with the resolutions of parliament; and if we succeed
in our endeavours, we shall command the more
attention, from meeting our antagonists on the
ground they have themselves selected.</p>

</div>

<p class="center fs110">COMPULSORY MANUMISSION CONTRARY TO THE
SPIRIT OF THE RESOLUTIONS OF PARLIAMENT.</p>


<p class="p2 noindent">The first of these often-quoted Resolutions declares,
“That it is expedient to adopt effectual
and decisive measures for <span class="allsmcap">AMELIORATING</span> the
condition of the slave population in His Majesty’s
colonies.”</p>

<p>It was to facilitate the accomplishment of this
object of amelioration <em>alone</em>, that many respectable
West India planters in England gave their sanction
to the resolution; and it is proper here to state,
that their interference and acquiescence was by no
means of that sweeping character claimed for it
by Earl Bathurst in his despatches to the colonies.
They explicitly declared, that in none of their proceedings
had they the intention of imposing restraints
or difficulties upon the colonial legislatures.</p>

<p>The Second Resolution is, “That through a
determined and persevering, but at the same time
judicious and temperate, enforcement of such
measures, this House looks forward to a progressive
improvement in the character of the
slave population, such as may <span class="allsmcap">PREPARE</span> them for
a participation in those civil rights and privileges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
which are enjoyed by other classes of His Majesty’s
subjects.”</p>

<p>This resolution is the one which the writer, who
has undertaken to illustrate the views of government,
quotes as decisive of the case. He says,
the object was “‘to adopt,’—aye, not only ‘to
adopt,’ but ‘enforce’ such measures ‘in a determined
and persevering, though at the same time
judicious and temperate manner,’ as would effect,—what
purpose?—the mitigation of the evils of
slavery?—as would remove the odious imputation
of inhumanity adhering to the West Indian
planters, so generally prevalent at that time
throughout England, whether true or false? <em>No:
to enforce such measures as might ‘prepare them
for a participation in those civil rights and privileges
which are enjoyed by other classes of His
Majesty’s subjects.’</em>”</p>

<p>The writer here deems contingent emancipation
to be broadly and unequivocally provided, and
in a very triumphant tone, he adds, “What! was
the intellect of the West Indian members of
the House of Commons who were present on
that day, so obtuse, that they could not understand
the meaning of those words?”</p>

<p>Perhaps not, to answer the ideas of this writer;
but it is to be hoped that the case will be different
with the legislature at large. It is surely quite
apparent, that if by this Resolution any legislative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
measure for effecting emancipation had been contemplated,
the term should be,“<span class="allsmcap">ADMIT</span> them to
a participation in civil rights.”</p>

<p>The colonial advocate argues throughout upon
this most erroneous assumption. The word “prepare”
cannot here admit of two meanings; it is
precise, definite, and strictly accordant with the
desideratum avowed in the first resolution. It was
not possible to convey in a more explicit manner
the obvious fact, that the slaves <em>are not as yet in a
state to receive freedom</em>. By “preparing them,” it
was understood that they had a probation to go
through; that their condition had to be materially
changed and improved; that, in fine, the fruits of
amelioration must have been made visible before
further measures were adopted. May we not
ask whether this Second Resolution be not as consistently
applicable to the progress which <em>voluntary</em>
manumissions are making towards an extinction
of slavery, as to any measure of compulsory manumission?
In the one case, as in the other, is it not
expedient to adopt such measures of amelioration,
as may effect a progressive improvement in the
character of the slave population, and <span class="allsmcap">PREPARE</span>
them for a participation in those civil rights and
privileges which are enjoyed by other classes of
His Majesty’s subjects?</p>

<p>What, let us demand, was the object of all the
powerful and extensive means taken to secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
moral and religious instruction—of the appointment
of the bishops and regular clergy? What
was it but to enable the negroes to appreciate
correctly the possession of civil privileges, in order
that hereafter we might have civilized beings, and
not barbarians, living in freedom in our colonies?</p>

<p>But if there could be the least ground for misinterpretation
in the Second, it must be speedily
removed by attending to the Third Resolution:
“That this House is anxious for the accomplishment
of this purpose at the earliest period that
shall be compatible with the well-being of the
slaves themselves, with the safety of the colonies,
and with a fair and equitable consideration of the
interests of private property.”</p>

<p>Here are laid down certain conditions which
must be complied with in whatever new measures
are introduced. These conditions constitute the
strong reliance of the colonists for protection, since
the letter of them definitely confirms what appears
to be the spirit of the two preceding Resolutions.</p>

<p>It may be proper to add that, besides the direct
declaration of these Resolutions, we have them
corroborated by the collateral authority of ministers.
In the debate in 1823, Mr. Canning not
only made no sort of allusion to compulsory manumission,
but that project does not appear to have
been even thought of. The mode of emancipation
contended for by the anti-colonial party had for its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
object the freedom of the rising generation of negroes;
but Mr. Canning both resisted this, and appeared
anxious to check any notion which might
be entertained, that plans for emancipation of any
kind were then in contemplation.</p>

<p>As a further and conclusive proof that compulsory
manumission was not, even by ministers
themselves, deemed to be implied in the Resolutions
proposed by Mr. Canning, but that it was an
after-thought of their own, we have the direct and
decisive testimony of Lord Bathurst.</p>

<p>In his Lordship’s circular despatch to the Governors
of Colonies having local legislatures, dated
9th July, 1823, and consequently near two months
after these Resolutions were passed, and when it
is presumed that the executive government had determined
on the details of such measures as were
to be adopted in furtherance of those Resolutions,
Lord Bathurst gives a comprehensive sketch of the
various amendments required in the colonial laws.</p>

<p>“The next subject,” says his Lordship, “to
which I must draw your attention, is the manumission
of slaves.”</p>

<p>After expressing his satisfaction, that the practice
of impeding manumission by the exaction of a
heavy fine or tax has been discontinued, his Lordship
anticipates a further facilitation to manumissions,
by the concurrence of each colonial legislature
in the final repeal of all such charges, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
all official fees. His Lordship thus appears to
consider the <em>expense</em> of obtaining emancipation, as
the chief obstacle which it was incumbent upon the
colonial legislatures to remove.</p>

<p>He then proceeds to specify all the remaining
obstacles which he thinks ought to be removed.</p>

<p>“The first obstacle to manumission arises from
the apprehension of this being resorted to by the
owner for the purpose of relieving himself from the
burden of maintaining infirm or aged slaves.—A
second obstacle to manumission seems to arise from
a presumed legal difficulty, in regard to the incapability
of a slave to make contracts.—A third, and
much more serious obstacle arises out of the legal
limitations to property in slaves; as in cases of
entail, family-settlement, or mortgage.—A difficulty
analogous to this arises out of doubtful or disputable
titles.”</p>

<p>How were these difficulties to be obviated? By
the <em>compulsory</em> enactments of the Trinidad order in
council? No such thing. They were not even contemplated.</p>

<p>“To remove,” says his Lordship, “all the preceding
obstacles to manumission, you will therefore
propose to the legislature of your colony to
pass a law to the following effect:—Permanent
commissioners should be appointed, who (on
application being made by, or on behalf of,
any slave, <em>with his master’s consent</em>) should ascertain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the names,” &amp;c. &amp;c. Parl. Pap. <i>Sess.</i>
1824. p. 10.</p>

<p>This passage attracted much attention in the colonies.
The Court of Policy in Demerara, in stating,
at a subsequent period, that it could not enact compulsory
manumission, since “It had not the right
to invade the property of its fellow-colonists, by
admitting that they can in any manner be deprived
of it contrary to the laws by which it is secured
to them,” remarked—“This principle is laid
down in Earl Bathurst’s letter of the 9th July,
1823, wherein <em>the consent of the master</em> is distinctly
coupled with the application to be made by or on
the behalf of a slave for freedom.”</p>

<p>This reply of the court of policy of Demerara is
copied into a pamphlet, entitled, “The West India
Question practically considered,” with which performance
the Colonial Department may possibly be
acquainted. It has the important words, “consent
of the master,” printed as above in italics, as if to
remind the government more forcibly of its own
previous statement.</p>

<p>After this exposition, may we not venture to ask,
who most deserves the reprobation of disinterested
members of the legislature? The ministerial advocate,
who asserts that compulsory manumission
was avowed from the outset, or the West Indian
who can produce Lord Bathurst’s own words to
prove the contrary?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<p>It must have been between July, 1823, and
March, 1824, that the innovation was devised.
But even at the latter period its bearings were not
developed.</p>

<p>Few members of the House of Commons can
have forgotten Mr. Canning’s luminous oration on
this occasion, when he described the evil consequences
of precipitation, and the difficulties
which opposed themselves to the termination of a
state like that of slavery.</p>

<p>It is not a little singular, that the same passage
which the apologist of the Colonial office quotes from
this speech as proving that emancipation was then
contemplated, may, with far more effect, be turned
against him. Adverting to the other measures of
amelioration, Mr. Canning, on the 16th March,
1824, observed: “By this process, and by these
degrees, may the slave be gradually fitted for the
last grand consummation of benefit, the power of
acquiring his freedom.”</p>

<p>The term here used, <span class="allsmcap">FITTED FOR</span>, is in strict consonance
with the word <span class="allsmcap">PREPARE</span>, employed by Mr.
Canning in the outset; and though he now, for
the first time, notices Compulsory Manumission, he
passes it over in a very cursory manner, either as
if anxious to avoid discussion, or desirous of concealing
its importance. An ordinary observer, on
reading the more recent despatches sent out to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
colonies, in which the views of government were
stated, would imagine that, in place of the guarded
expressions originally used, terms impelling to
quicker and more extensive proceedings had since
been substituted.</p>

<p>Consistency is a delicate word to political ears.
Lest any misunderstanding should arise, or any
member of the legislature should conceive himself
shackled by former votes, it was necessary to explain
fully to which side the charge attaches of having
abandoned former principles.</p>

<p>Having therefore removed that injurious bias
which it appears to be the object of the advocate of
the Colonial Department to raise against the West
Indians, on the ground of inconsistency, it now becomes
desirable to discuss the principle of compulsory
manumission on its own merits.</p>

<p>It will be found that the opposition of the West
Indians is not directed against an imaginary evil;
that opposition now is very different from those
minor objections locally entertained against particular
plans of amelioration; and that, above all, if
government, with a view of courting popular favour,
have innovated upon their original understanding
with the West Indian party, they have neither
chosen the most benevolent nor the wisest mode to
accomplish their own end of terminating slavery.</p>

<p>We propose to pursue the examination upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
grounds marked out by the Parliamentary Resolutions
already quoted, in the order in which the importance
of the several heads may be presumed to
receive attention from a legislative assembly.</p>

<p>1. Justice, as regards the right of property.</p>

<p>2. Humanity, as regards the well-being of the
negroes.</p>

<p>3. Sound Policy, as regards the safety of the
Colonies.</p>

<p class="center fs110">INFRINGEMENT OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY.</p>


<p class="p2 noindent">Loss of property may be brought upon the Proprietor
of a West India estate in two ways:</p>

<p>First, By introducing a new tone of feeling
among the Negroes, and converting good servants
into bad.</p>

<p>Secondly, By abstracting such a number of efficient
hands from an estate, that the remainder are
incompetent to carry on its cultivation in an effective
manner, or to render its fixed capital productive.</p>

<h3><i>Section 1.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">THE CONVERSION OF GOOD SERVANTS INTO BAD.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">If we imagine an estate, with a given number of
negroes, to produce three hundred hogsheads of
sugar a year, few will be inclined to doubt the disposition
of the proprietor to increase its production,
if practicable, to three hundred and fifty or four
hundred. What are the means, then, to effect this
object, without increasing the number of labourers?
The proprietor finds himself possessed of a
number of people, the development of whose full
capability for labour depends upon their treatment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
If they are prompted to work with willingness and
satisfaction, skill in the various branches of work
to be performed speedily displays itself. If thus
some of the slaves can be converted from ordinary
labourers into good tradesmen, and if those in
the field can be taught to use their utmost dexterity
in field-cultivation, a much more profitable
division of labour than hitherto will be accomplished.
Through this improvement there is less
expense in superintendence, there is more work
procured from the steady government of the negroes
without rigorous coercion, and the cultivation is
extended generally, from a better and more skilful
distribution of the various employments on the
estate.</p>

<p>To accomplish this condition of things, the proprietor
is induced to grant to the slaves every
reasonable indulgence and benefit. He uses a
discriminating power, bestowing reward upon the
well-deserving, and withholding it from the vicious;
and thus holds up a double example to the rest.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the slaves, finding that the
master deals out his favour with strict impartiality,
are cheered under their labour by the assurance
that their exertions will be appreciated, and emulate
each other in assiduity and good conduct.</p>

<p>It is perfectly evident, therefore, that it is the
first interest of the master to have the minds of
his people easy and contented; and that whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
tends to destroy their tranquillity occasions to him
inevitable loss of property. He will not then be
able to avail himself of that skill and willingness
to work above described, and instead of having
his three hundred hogsheads increased to four,
which he might otherwise have expected from the
greater diffusion of intelligence among the rising
generation, he will have his produce diminished
to two hundred, and rendered still less and less,
as discontent spreads and becomes more deeply
rooted among his people.</p>

<p>It is one of the worst features of compulsory
manumission, that it must inspire this discontent.
Is it surprising, therefore, that it should excite such
strenuous opposition? The colonists know well,
that there is not an instance in our colonies of
free negroes working steadily in the field for hire;
and that if their people be compulsorily freed, the
cultivation of their estates must be superseded.
There will no longer be a motive for the master, as
at present, to bestow benefits upon the slave; on
the contrary, every indulgence granted would only
tend to swell that sum which is ultimately to be
employed to the master’s injury. The negroes will
learn, that benefits must cease to flow to them
from their masters: hence the interests of the two,
instead of being reciprocal as hitherto, become
directly opposed to each other.</p>

<p>It is beyond any effort or precaution of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
master, when he can procure no other labourers,
to retrieve the injury he thus sustains. His property
is placed at the mercy of his own servants.
In the practical operation of the measure, his best
and most serviceable people will become the first
discontented. They will, as a natural result, be
directly induced to suppress their skill, zeal, and
willingness to work, or in other ways depreciate
their personal value.</p>

<p>When slaves have the power to enforce their
freedom from their owners by such a process as
that of appraisement, those who are of bad character
are comparatively rewarded, while those
who are really meritorious are punished.</p>

<p>Thus, on the same estate, a disorderly and
unprofitable slave may be readily parted with by
his master for fifty pounds, whilst another, a steady,
intelligent, and assiduous slave, might, for these
good qualities, be worth three hundred. Yet, disproportionate
as are the characters and consequent
value of the two, the desire for freedom will operate
with both; but how strikingly unequal are the terms
upon which they are to obtain the same reward.
To the one who is profligate and undeserving the
obstacle is trivial. On the contrary, the meritorious
slave, applying to his master to know the amount
of his ransom, finds it magnified above that of his
fellow sixfold. He cannot fail to be struck with
the largeness of the amount, and the time requisite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
to raise it. Such an obvious departure from the
principles of common equity, as this, must engender
discontent, and prompt the meritorious individual
to seek for the cause of this difference in value.
He will conceive it gross injustice, that a bad
character, who has always disregarded his master’s
interests, should quickly get his freedom, whilst he
himself, who has constantly studied those interests,
must wait for it through a course of years lengthened
in exact proportion to the value of his services.</p>

<p>When the measure fairly begins to work, the
grievance is greatly aggravated.</p>

<p>It is intended, that a proportion of the capital
sunk in the lands and buildings of each estate
shall be added to the value of each slave.</p>

<p>Earl Bathurst, in his despatch to Sir Benjamin
D’Urban, of the 25th February, 1826, says:—</p>

<p>“If, in the process of time, it should be unfortunately
found, that the slaves thus manumitted
altogether abandon their owners, and refuse to
work as free persons, the owner not having the
means, by reason of the Abolition Act, to supply
the loss of his slaves, and not being able to engage
any free labourer for his sugar-plantations, the
price which must then be assigned to the loss
of each slave must have a direct reference to that
state in which the plantation will be placed by
the progressive reduction of the means of cultivating
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p>Under this plan it will be the <em>deserving</em> slaves
who will have to pay for the lands and buildings.</p>

<p>The higher the personal value of the slave, the
greater is his <em>relative</em> utility to the plantation, and
the greater must be the recompense awarded to
the proprietor for superseded cultivation. The
relative utility of a negro of bad character may
thus be estimated at not more than ten pounds,
while that of a trustworthy individual may rise
so high as one hundred and fifty. In both these
cases, the respective sums have to be added to the
slave’s personal value, before his master can be
said to have received an equivalent for his liberation.
If the personal value of a slave of bad
character be estimated at 50<i>l.</i>, the compensation
of 10<i>l.</i> for his <em>relative</em> utility to the plantation
being added, will make a sum of 60<i>l.</i> only, as
the price of his manumission. If the personal
value of the skilful and zealous slave be estimated
at 300<i>l.</i>, the equivalent of 150<i>l.</i> for his <em>relative</em>
utility to the plantation being added, will require
as much as 450<i>l.</i> to be raised for the purchase
of his manumission.</p>

<p>Here the impediment is increased from six to
eight fold.</p>

<p>But there is yet further injustice. Not only are
different descriptions of cultivation carried on in
the colonies, but the same species of cultivation may
greatly vary on estates contiguous to each other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
from difference of soil, or other local circumstances.
Accordingly as those circumstances are more or less
favourable, in a corresponding proportion will be
the value of the slave, and the appraisers will be
called upon to adjust this value, thus varying in
different districts of the same colony.</p>

<p>Suppose the fixed capital sunk on a coffee or
cotton plantation to be 5,000<i>l.</i>, and that sunk
on an adjoining sugar-plantation to be 25,000<i>l.</i>,
while each possesses the same number of negroes.
One of these from each plantation, of precisely
similar capability and character, demands his
freedom. The first finds there is to be an addition
of but 10<i>l.</i> to his price; not from inferiority
of character or skill, but from the accidental circumstance
of his living on a plantation where the
amount of fixed capital is small. The man from
the latter, the sugar-estate, finds it, as before
stated, so high as 150<i>l.</i>, making the difficulty of
obtaining freedom perhaps double, as compared
with his companion and equal. The same argument
would apply even to two estates, which both
produced sugar, provided the buildings and machinery
on the one were better and more complete
than that of the other, or the land more productive.</p>

<p>Thus, the more extensively that machinery has
been introduced to facilitate and lighten labour, the
more will it be to the prejudice of the slaves.
When the supply of labourers is short, to introduce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the most advanced and highest description of machinery
is all-important and desirable, and the
main step to advance a colony to prosperity. But
in the new measure proposed, this is checked at
once, because no proprietor would think of an
outlay, when it could be withdrawn in no other
way than by pittances wrung from his best slaves,
in their eagerness for freedom.</p>

<p>In contemplating these several facts, can there
be a moment’s hesitation in regard to the discontent
created? Let us imagine a serviceable man
on a sugar-plantation applying for his freedom.
He has formed in his own mind an estimate of
what he ought to pay, and he betakes himself to
the appraiser, with the money in his hand. To
his astonishment he is asked a sum far beyond
his means of payment; he cannot comprehend
the cause; and no alternative remains to him
but to go back and brood over his disappointment.
When he finds his long-cherished hopes utterly frustrated;
when, too, he perceives a worthless fellow,
distinguished only for idleness and debauchery,
now sporting and enjoying himself at liberty all
day long, perhaps laughing at the deserving individual
who remains in servitude; when he sees
his acquaintance on some neighbouring plantation
attain his freedom, merely from his chancing to
live on an estate where less machinery was used,
will he, in common reason, return to his duty a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
contented man? Is he not goaded on to renounce
his better qualities, when he is thus made to feel,
that they are insuperable impediments to the attainment
of his natural wishes? He discovers that
discontent is his surest remedy; that he has only to
display the sullenness which he actually feels; that,
in one word, he has but to become a bad subject, in
order to obtain liberty the more speedily.</p>

<p>Can then the sturdiest champions of compulsory
manumission attempt to maintain, that if this man
was worth a dollar a day before this occurrence, he
will be worth as much still; and if the return from
his labour be reduced one-half or two-thirds, will
any man contend that a direct violation of property
has not been inflicted?</p>

<p>We have confined our attention, hitherto, to the
most deserving slaves, because their welfare should
be chiefly consulted in every new measure. But
with the gang at large the injurious tendency is
scarcely less striking. Besides a systematic practice
of repressing dexterity and usefulness, the
slave may even resort to bodily disablement, in
order that his price may be lowered to his means.
Such practices are known to exist at present, where
there is no higher temptation than that of idling in
the sick-house; and there could therefore be little
expectation, that the practice would not increase
under so much more powerful an inducement. It
is vain to argue, that there are reasons, such as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
fear of correction from his master or the magistrate,
of sufficient weight to deter him from this course—the
object for which he strives is perpetually in
his view, and will inspire him to brave in its pursuit
any present punishment, well knowing that the
owner’s patience must at length be exhausted.</p>

<p>With the negroes generally, there is also a
direct encouragement to theft, since, under the peculiar
circumstances of West India cultivation, the
master’s property is, necessarily, much exposed, and
liable to be stolen by his slaves. Even at present,
the quantity stolen annually is ascertained to be
very great. Crime usually increases in proportion
to temptation; and, under the proposed enactment,
the slave must become habituated to fraudulent
propensities, and all his ingenuity stimulated to the
commission of secret theft. Thus is caused loss
of property, both directly and indirectly: directly,
by the sum taken from the proprietor in the property
stolen; indirectly, by obstructing the steady
government of the plantation, and occasioning unavoidable
loss of labour in the services of the slave.</p>

<p>These are vital evils; and can any attempt be
made to correct them, particularly the most important
one relating to self-depreciation?</p>

<p>Lord Bathurst, in his despatch of the 25th
February, 1826, acknowledges, that great mischief
would ensue, if manumission were obtained by
other means than those of individual and habitual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
industry; and, in alluding to the possibility of a
slave’s purchase-money being improperly obtained,
his Lordship observes—</p>

<p>“For the sake of the community, indeed, such
indiscriminate manumissions ought to be prevented;
for, undoubtedly, if the purchase-money were
obtained from any fund which may be formed for
the liberation of slaves, there would be no test of
previous habits of industry, of which there is presumptive
evidence where the money is procured
by the honest earnings of the slave. To supply
this defect it may be provided, that in such cases
a certificate of good conduct for five years should
be required of the Protector of slaves, before the
manumission should be completed.”</p>

<p>It is not difficult to perceive, that this idea of a
certificate is perfectly nugatory. Who is to give
it? The Protector, it seems. How is it possible
for the Protector to judge of the private character of
the thousands under his charge? Mr. President
Wray, sitting in the Court of Policy, in Demerara,
admitted, “that in a population of more than 70,000
negroes, the protector could not be supposed to be
acquainted with individual characters.” To the
proposed amendment, that the existence of habits
of industry and good conduct should be shown
before the same tribunal which inquired into the
manner in which the property was obtained, it was
urged, that no such tribunal would have better information<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
than the protector himself; and any certificate
of good behaviour coming from incompetent
judges, must prove altogether futile as regards
protection to the proprietor.</p>

<p>If the framers of the measure had interrogated
managers or overseers as to the length of time
and the close attention it requires to understand
the character of the negroes, even of a moderately-sized
gang, they would have little thought
of expecting a single public officer to remedy the
difficulty.</p>

<p>But if the protectors were multiplied from one
to a thousand, and did nothing else but watch over
the individual character of the slaves, the remedy
must be fallacious. On the broad principle of the
measure itself, no system of appraisement, no reference
to previous character, can meet the artifices
which a slave may employ to depreciate his
value; because many of such artifices, depending
on the suppression of skill or zeal, being of a negative
character, defy detection; and, even were they
detected, detriment to the proprietor’s interests
must ensue, since a willing has been changed
into a discontented labourer.</p>

<p>Upon the rising generation, too, of the negroes,
the operation of the same baneful policy of self-deterioration
must increase. The whole of the
youthful class, whose faculties are just dawning,
will be taught to suppress everything like acuteness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
and to stifle every indication of future habits of
industry.</p>

<p>Compulsory manumission, therefore, contains the
worst principle of evil, a principle of growth.
Each succeeding year will make more evident to
the negroes the means with which they have been
invested for self-depreciation; and each additional
instance of its successful adoption by their fellows
encourage numbers to resort to the same pernicious
artifices.</p>

<p>How miserable, then, is the expedient of <em>partially</em>
questioning certain individuals in the colonies, who,
thus interrogated, may pronounce that in the <em>present</em>
condition of the slaves the measure would be inoperative,
while the same persons, if questioned
with a view to the <em>future</em> effects of the measure after
ten or fifteen years of its adoption, would predict
a widely different result!</p>

<p>The writer of the “Remarks” seems unwilling to
contemplate the future, and condemns prospective
arguments as speculative and merely matter of
opinion. But if the negro prefer a state of idleness
to one of constrained exertion, it follows that he
must earnestly desire to obtain his freedom. If
he have repugnance to labour, he will seek his
freedom by those means which are easiest. If
he possess common reason, he must perceive that
the easiest of all methods lies in self-depreciation.</p>

<p>Would it not, then, be contrary to all principles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of equity or sound legislation, to subject what is
thus a self-evident proposition to the test of experiment,
since, ere the result of that experiment could
be ascertained, irreparable injury must have been
produced?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In reality, a part only of the subject has been
treated of in Lord Bathurst’s despatch, and in the
“Remarks,” inasmuch as they regard only those
negroes who may be freed under the operation
of the measure, and overlook those who, from
inability to procure their freedom, still remain on
the plantation.</p>

<p>But it has been shown, that greater deterioration
of property may occur from an improper feeling
excited among the negroes who remain, than from
the more direct loss of labour occasioned by the
abstraction of those who become free.</p>


<h3><i>Section 2.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">LOSS ARISING, IF A NUMBER OF EFFECTIVE HANDS
BE TAKEN FROM THE PLANTATION.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">The capital sunk in land, buildings and machinery
is known to be very extensive in West India plantations.</p>

<p>We have now to inquire whether, under the
mode proposed, the proprietor will receive fair
indemnification for this capital, from the slaves who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
may obtain their freedom. It is conceived that, in
every point of view, loss is occasioned; and that
while the plan of increasing the price of the slave
according to his relative utility to the estate is
calculated to engender the greatest discontent generally,
it at the same time affords inadequate compensation
to the proprietor, in regard to those who
may purchase their manumission.</p>

<p>Lord Bathurst and the writer of the “Remarks”
consider the means of fair compensation for the
fixed capital to be secured, as appears in the following
extract from his Lordship’s despatch:—</p>

<p>“If by these regulations an adequate compensation
be not secured to the owner, it must either
be because the persons who are authorised to
decide upon the amount are not likely to be fit or
fair arbitrators, or because there are restrictions
which will prevent the arbitrators from the free
exercise of their judgment. Now it must be admitted
nothing can be fairer than the proposed
selection of arbitrators in the Trinidad Order: viz.,
that in the event of the owner and the slave not
agreeing on the price of the slave’s manumission,
the owner should appoint one, the protector of
slaves another, and that an umpire should be
appointed by the chief judge. It is clear that an
arbitration on such principle would protect the
interests of the owner, and if there were any objection
it would be that the bias was in his favour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
As to restrictions or limitations, there are none to
obstruct the free exercise of their judgment.”</p>

<p>To this it may, in the first place, be replied, that
the principle of appraisement in its practical operation
supposes the price of slaves to continue to be
regulated in the West India colonies by competition
in the market, like commodities in commerce.</p>

<p>Before we go further, then, let us examine how
West India property stands at present.</p>

<p>The following are the Gazette average prices
of sugar for the last seven years: viz.,</p>

<p class="pad6 noindent">
1820   <span class="pad4">35<i>s.</i>   0<i>d.</i></span><br>
1821   <span class="pad4">31 &#160; 0</span><br>
1822   <span class="pad4">29 &#160; 4½</span><br>
1823   <span class="pad4">34 &#160; 6</span><br>
1824   <span class="pad4">30 11½</span><br>
1825   <span class="pad4">38 &#160; 7¼</span><br>
1826   <span class="pad4">35 &#160; 6½</span><br>
</p>

<p>It might be presumed, that the amount of capital
which an individual would be willing to vest in the
purchase of a property would be proportioned to its
net returns. But it can be proved, that in 1819,
65,000<i>l.</i> sterling was offered for a sugar-estate in
Jamaica, and refused, as below its estimated value.
About that period it was considered, that the increasing
consumption of sugar, while the means of
production were limited, presented a very favourable
prospect for the West India planter. Accordingly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
in the year 1820, 70,000<i>l.</i> sterling was offered
for the abovementioned estate, and also refused for
the same reason. But when the proceedings in
this country in 1823 and 1824 began to operate, a
mighty change took place. It can be shown that
distrust gradually arose, and as the proceedings
became more and more critical, in the same proportion
and as quickly did the value of property
progressively decline. The demands of alarmed
creditors from all quarters fell on the planters; they
became embarrassed; and the very same property
for which, in 1820, 70,000<i>l.</i> sterling had been refused,
when again put up for sale in 1826, found
no real bidding higher than 32,000<i>l.</i> currency,
being less than 23,000<i>l.</i> sterling.</p>

<p>Strong as this instance appears to be, others
equally forcible could be adduced, of the ruinous
deterioration of West India property from the like
cause; and they exemplify the nature of those boons
which the writer of the “Remarks” affirms to have
been accorded to the colonists, and “for which
they should feel grateful.”</p>

<p>If a decline in the value of the capital has ensued,
whilst the price of the produce has remained nearly
the same, it is proof positive that the depreciation
of West India property is not attributable to circumstances
purely mercantile, but that it is owing
to the proceedings of the British legislature.</p>

<p>It is essential to keep this circumstance in mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and to examine the mode of appraisement prospectively,
when the principle of supply and
demand no longer exists, as regards the objects
to be appraised.</p>

<p>It is apparent, that to allow of a properly-constituted
market-price, there must be purchasers;
but if the principle of compulsory manumission be
admitted, after what has been just stated relative
to the deterioration in the value of property already
produced, will any purchaser of slaves be found?
Under the manifold evils detailed in the preceding
section, no capitalist henceforward would think of
making investments upon West India securities,
and all transfer of property would be at an end.</p>

<p>The appraisers are employed to fix a price
between conflicting representations of master and
slave. But can a criterion for equitable adjustment
be formed? The slave himself is the only
purchaser who appears in the market, and in this
condition of things any mode of appraisement must
be unjust and injurious to the capitalist which
assumes that colonial cultivation will continue unchanged,
in the event of the proposed measure
being carried into effect; and which does not
take into the account the aversion which every
capitalist will then feel to making a precarious
investment dependent upon the uncertain services
of the slaves.</p>

<p>This is founded upon the most simple principle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
If a decrease in the value of capital have already
occurred beyond what is attributable to circumstances
purely mercantile, and is solely occasioned
by the threatened measures of Government, it is
a fair inference that a further decrease would ensue
if such threatened measures were put into execution;
and the effects of that opinion prevailing
throughout the colonies, must render the chance
of fully withdrawing the fixed capital more and
more precarious, as the evils of the measure became
more widely developed.</p>

<p>Let us suppose a sugar-plantation, with two
hundred negroes, worth 40,000<i>l.</i>; one-half sunk in
lands and buildings, the other half the value of the
slaves. Accordingly as the negroes progressively
free themselves, the 20,000<i>l.</i> sunk in lands and
buildings has to be apportioned among them, and
added to the price of their manumission. Now it
must be recollected, that <em>the whole</em> of the two
hundred negroes are requisite to carry on profitable
cultivation. The land and buildings cannot be
disposed of, or circumscribed to suit a more limited
business, as would be the case with premises in
this country when a manufacturer reduced the
number of his workmen.</p>

<p>After a number of men, then, are freed, the
proprietor is left with a great concern upon his
hands without people to carry it on. To be fully
remunerated for the property sunk in that concern,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
the people remaining would have to pay, as he
gradually becomes more and more short of hands,
a prodigious sum for their freedom. Is it possible,
from what has been stated, that he could receive
full indemnification? Let it be recollected, that
it will soon be, not a quota, but the <em>entire</em> of the
fixed capital, which the efficient negroes, applying
for freedom, will have to pay to indemnify their
masters,—and in actual practice can this be done?</p>

<p>The writer of the “Remarks” illustrates the case
by comparing a sugar-estate to a mill with a number
of buckets! The reader, it is presumed, will
be tempted to smile at the idea of considering the
negroes as mere passive machines, devoid of those
feelings, passions, and intelligence, which it is
their master’s chief solicitude to call into existence.</p>

<p>But, to pass over the narrow and partial view
of the subject here displayed, even were we to
indulge the writer in his singular mode of illustration,
it fails to establish his object. He says,
if twenty buckets are attached to a wheel, and
four be removed, the proprietor will be entitled
to be remunerated for whatever loss of work this
removal occasioned; and if the work turned off
were diminished, from incompetency of power in
the wheel, not only in the proportion of twenty
to sixteen, being one-fifth, but in the proportion
of two-fifths, then would the proprietor be entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
to receive, as equitable compensation, two-fifths of
the value in place of one.</p>

<p>Now it is important to reflect, that if four buckets
be taken away from the wheel, its motion may
not only be diminished in a greater ratio than
two-fifths, but it may be <em>stopped altogether</em>.</p>

<p>This is the proper application of such an illustration
to the circumstances of a sugar-estate.
If forty efficient negroes be removed out of two
hundred, being the same proportion as in the
assumed case of the buckets, will any person,
acquainted with the colonies, maintain that cultivation
could continue? An estate which had produced
two hundred hogsheads of sugar would not
merely be reduced two-fifths of that amount, that
is to say, to one hundred and twenty hogsheads,
but it would be altogether abandoned, because its
returns would not cover its expenses.</p>

<p>The author of the bucket-illustration must be
sensible of its fallacy, if he reflect that at some one
point, the wheel, from its diminution of buckets,
must stop.</p>

<p>The question is, as regards the cultivation of
sugar, will this point soon be reached? Little is
required to be said on this head, if the proprietors
are prepared to establish the fact, that even at
present they can scarcely spare one man.</p>

<p>Lord Bathurst acknowledges, indeed, the ultimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
improbability that the slaves could of themselves
indemnify their master for the entire capital he has
sunk; and his Lordship says, when the price of
manumission rises from 100 to 500<i>l.</i>, then it will
be time for the nation to come forward. A most
consolatory prospect! And what are the proprietors
to do <em>before the nation does come forward</em>?
When the discussion is beginning, and before the
public are disposed to put their hands into their
pockets, the proprietors buildings, machinery,
roads, dams, are going into dilapidation, and he
is a ruined man.</p>

<p>When we prove injury in the principle, it is
scarcely necessary to descend to discuss the practice.
Many colonists view with alarm the great
power given to the Protector, and other officers of
government. But let us pass over details. It is only
necessary to reflect upon what the appraiser has to
do, to perceive that the mode of working must be
as bad as the design, and that the whole process
must be vague and mere guess-work. Even admitting
the very doubtful proposition, that impartial
arbitrators could be selected, numerous peculiarities
may exist to obstruct the formation of a sound
judgment in regard to the value of a part of the
planter’s stock, in consequence of the manner in
which the whole is rendered profitable.</p>

<p>It is to repeat the opinion of every intelligent
person recently returned from the colonies, to declare,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
that it is perfectly impossible for any appraiser,
no matter how intelligent, experienced, or impartial,
correctly to estimate the value of a slave, in order
to award compensation in the manner described
by Lord Bathurst.</p>


<h3><i>Section 3.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">PLANTATIONS BURDENED WITH EXPENSES, WHILE
THE GROSS RETURNS ARE DIMINISHED.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">Having shown, in the preceding section, that the
fixed capital of an estate cannot be removed, we
have now to show that the necessary expenses of
carrying on its cultivation cannot be diminished.</p>

<p>Each proprietor is by law obliged to maintain the
aged, the infirm, and the helpless, upon his estate.
This duty he performs with the utmost cheerfulness.
He can hold out to his able negroes no stronger
incentive to good conduct than the assurance verified
in their parents, that they will pass the evening
of life in rest and contentment, with every little
want provided for. The spectacle itself is one of
the most agreeable which can strike the eye of
the stranger; it is peculiarly grateful to the feelings
of the negro; and most forcibly illustrates the
happy state of things when benefits are made to
How from the master alone. Compulsory manumission
severs the link which makes this obligation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
mutual, for it gives to the master all the expense,
and deprives him of the benefit.</p>

<p>On most West India plantations not more than
one-third part of each gang can be considered as
efficient for field-cultivation, there being included
the old and infirm, the infant and the helpless, all
of whom are unserviceable, but whom the proprietor
is bound by every consideration to support.</p>

<p>The young and able, those in the prime of
life, and under the strongest influence of the
passions, to whom all the allurements of idleness
present themselves in full force, would lose no time
in availing themselves of any opportunity to go
at large.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the old slaves on a plantation,
in whom the ardent passions have subsided, knowing
that they must soon come to be exempt from
work, and entitled to that maintenance gratuitously
from their master, which in a state of freedom they
would have to earn for themselves, would make
no attempt to procure their own liberation, but
would devote their earnings, and any accumulation
of money they may have already made, to the
ransom of their children.</p>

<p>This double operation, therefore, of the young
and efficient freeing themselves, or being freed
by their aged connexions; and the superannuated
and infirm remaining to be supported by the proprietor,
would leave the burdens of a plantation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
undiminished, while its ability to bear them was
nearly annihilated.</p>

<p>With regard to the other portion, from whom no
labour is obtained, namely, the infants, the proprietor
is induced at present to treat them with the
utmost care, were it only for their future value.
But the prospect of obtaining their future services
might soon be changed.</p>

<p>Slavery, considered as an hereditary condition,
is perpetuated on the side of the mother only; if
means were taken to purchase all the female children,
no calculation regarding relative value could
be made, and the property of each proprietor must
become extinct with the lives of his present negroes.</p>

<p>Now it is fair to apprehend, that the means of
obtaining manumission might be improperly employed,
for the purpose of exterminating slavery,
regardless of all injury to the capitalist. Whether
those means would be supplied from a fund raised
in this country by speculative theorists hostile to
the colonies, or, whether the slaves themselves
would be, by such persons, instigated to purchase
the female children, the result would be equally
injurious to the proprietor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>


<h3><i>Section 4.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">CONTRARY TO THE LAW OF MORTGAGE.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">Few persons require to be told, that the proportion
of property under mortgage in the West Indies is
considerable. It is singular, that, in the various discussions
to which the Colonial Question has given
rise, so little attention has been directed to the
interests thus involved. Independently of the mortgagees
themselves, it is the direct advantage of
the planters to have every facility open for the
raising of loans to meet temporary difficulties.</p>

<p>The act of Parliament, the 13 Geo. III. c. 14, invites
loans from aliens, on the security of leasehold or
freehold estates, in His Majesty’s West Indian Colonies.
The 14 Geo. III. c. 79 legalizes the taking
of interest by British subjects, for sums advanced
on mortgage, and securities of any lands, tenements,
hereditaments, slaves, and other things, at
the rate allowed by the law of the colony where
the mortgaged property lies. And the 3 Geo. IV.
c. 47, further regulates the rate of interest, and
extends its provisions to persons advancing capital
in this country.</p>

<p>On the faith of these enactments, large investments
on mortgage have been made. Slaves are
recognised in them, as property in fee-simple,
absolute, which has been confirmed by decisions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
in our courts, both of law and equity. Consequently,
all mortgagees rest their security not on
Colonial enactments, but on British Acts of Parliament;
and the law relating to mortgaged property
in the colonies must be analogous to the law
relating to mortgaged property in England.</p>

<p>By the law of England, when woods or messuages
are included in a mortgage, none of those
woods or messuages can be sold or alienated,
either collectively or in part, by the mortgagor, or
by any other known authority, even though the
proceeds of such sale should be appropriated to
the benefit of the mortgagee, without the express
consent and concurrence of the latter; the law
giving to him the sole privilege of determining as
to whatever may affect his security.</p>

<p>By the same law of England, when slaves are
expressly specified in a mortgage on West India
property, neither the proprietor, nor any other
known authority, can legally sell such slaves, even
though the proceeds be applied in liquidation of
the mortgage, unless it be with the previous consent
of the mortgagee.</p>

<p>Yet it does not appear, that Earl Bathurst has
explicitly provided for the claims of the mortgagee,
who has lent his money in the firm reliance that
the law has guaranteed, both to himself and to the
mortgagor, the full effects of the stipulation of the
mortgage contract.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>

<p>But if the slaves, being in law real property,
on which the mortgagee holds a lien, be permitted
at their will to separate themselves from the plantation,
it must weaken the security of the mortgagee,
by removing the instruments through which
the fixed capital was rendered productive, and by
the employment of which for the benefit of the
mortgagor, there was a reasonable confidence that
the mortgage might ultimately be redeemed.</p>

<p>And in regard to the purchase-money paid by
the slave to his owner, as the price of his liberation,
if the amount go at once into the hands of
the mortgagee, it is an injustice to the debtor,
because he had a right to expect a rate of profit
from his cultivation, much higher than the mere
interest paid for his loan; and it is illegal, because
it is beyond the terms of his contract with the
mortgagee.</p>

<p>If, again, the money be deposited in some public
chest, it is illegal and unjust to both parties:
unjust, because the removal of an efficient hand
entered not into the calculations of the owner of
the plantation, and by the decrease of its produce
from subtracted labour, he finds his debt not diminishing
but growing larger, while the mortgagee
runs the risk of losing his money;—illegal, because
the stipulation forms no part of the mortgage
contract.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<p>When we show that illegality is added to injustice,
we may close the case on the part of the proprietor.</p>

<p>Let us sum up the objections.</p>

<p>If not one man is freed, compulsory manumission
changes his good slaves into bad ones. If
any are freed, he gets inadequate remuneration
for their loss. It unjustly makes the burdens on
his estates perpetual; and in case of mortgages,
is contrary to the statute-law of the realm.</p>

<p>Is compulsory manumission then compatible with
a fair and equitable consideration of the rights of
private property? Will any member of the legislature
be willing to confirm an act of the executive,
which is expressly contrary to the Resolution to
which Parliament became pledged in 1823?</p>

<p class="center fs110">INJURY TO THE WELL-BEING OF THE SLAVES.</p>


<p class="p2 noindent">It is presumed, that the great object contemplated
by the British nation is to civilize the blacks living
in our colonies. The crime of taking them from
their own country is long past by; but it surely
cannot be intended to compensate them for their
former wrongs, by replunging them into barbarism.
Yet it is to be feared that this is the consummation
to result from compulsory manumission.</p>


<h3 id="ch4sect1"><i>Section 1.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">COUNTERACTS THE INCENTIVES TO CIVILISATION.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">A free peasantry in the colonies is the desideratum
sought by the framers of the measure. It is argued,
that men are creatures of habit, and that if the negro,
by voluntary industry, amass such a sum as will
procure his ransom, the habit of working will have
become firmly established, and he will continue to
labour when he has obtained his freedom.</p>

<p>This argument has been entirely refuted by the
simple question, What is the <em>motive</em> for exertion in
the two cases? Before the negro became free, he
had the strongest of inducements perpetually present
to his mind—the attainment of freedom, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
the privilege of enjoying himself uncontrolled. It
was not for the money that he worked, but for that
which the money would procure him. When he
has, at length, attained his freedom, what motive
has he to work further? Name one object, equivalent,
in his estimation, to the irksomeness of
labour; the one-inspiring aim is attained, the stimulus
is gone.</p>

<p>But it is not enough for our purpose to show, that
industry is eventually superseded. We can establish,
that the very means held out are themselves the most
efficacious in producing this pernicious result. It is
said that men are creatures of habits, and do not
speedily change them. We meet our opponents on
this ground.</p>

<p>If you demand of a man, living in a country
imperfectly civilised, for what reason he works,
he will answer, that he may purchase food. But
put the same question to a man in a state highly
civilised, and he will reply, that besides the purchase
of food, he requires good clothing, lodging,
and other comforts which have become <em>habitual</em> to
him, and in which custom would make it disreputable
in him not to indulge.</p>

<p>Let us apply this to the negro in the West Indies.
At present his artificial wants are extremely
low; and if certain habits, such as above described,
have to operate hereafter upon him as incentives
to exertion, is it not requisite that they should now
begin to be established? Suppose a negro, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
rearing stock of various descriptions, can earn a
dollar per week—should he not be taught to lay
out that sum in the purchase of articles, for instance,
of personal decoration for himself and family, or
of additional conveniences in his hut, in the display
of which he will henceforth take a pride?</p>

<p>By such means it must be, that, in the lapse of
time, he will feel that he must work longer than
is merely necessary to procure him food, because
he has other wants to satisfy.</p>

<p>But compulsory manumission directly counteracts
this process. It prompts him to the most sordid
self-denial. Its language to him is—“Spend not
your weekly dollar, but rather hoard it with the
most scrupulous rigour; improve not the condition
of your family:—in a word, confine your wants to
the state of the savage.”</p>

<p>The necessary consequence will be, that when
he attains to freedom, all his physical wants remain
unchanged. And are these the boasted steps
which have been taken to elevate the condition
of the slaves? It is certainly a novel mode of establishing
a free peasantry, to commence by divesting
them of every stimulus to exertion.</p>


<h3><i>Section 2.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">DEBAUCHERY AND CRIME ENCOURAGED.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">It will not have escaped the observation of the
intelligent reader, that if compulsory manumission<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
leads to self-depreciation, by directly suggesting
and encouraging a suppression of dexterity and
usefulness, the same end may be attained by debasing
the moral character. Every species of
debauchery is, in point of fact, encouraged, to constrain
the proprietor to offer little impediment to
the freedom of his slaves.</p>

<p>Good conduct frequently renders a negro more
valuable even than skill, and it thus becomes a
principal impediment to the attainment of his freedom.
In the case of a drunken, worthless character
on a plantation, the proprietor, instead of opposing
his liberation, will be glad to get rid of him at a
small amount, because he is continually giving
trouble and setting a bad example.</p>

<p>If there be any truth in the maxim of moralists, that
the road to vice is alluring in itself, what must be the
result when men are urged upon it, by the strongest
incentives which can be supposed to operate with
them? The profligate slave may purchase his freedom
within a year,—the virtuous has to wait for it
ten years, and perhaps all his life, without success.
What is this but to teach him, in the most emphatic
manner, that if he were but profligate and worthless,
he would find no such difficulties? Under the
common operations of human nature, it is impossible,
when the whole moral code is reversed—when
virtue is punished and vice rewarded, that any
number of men in a state like that of the negroes
will continue virtuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<p>We shall here be again reminded about the
certificate of good character which is to be required.
But if this question be to be discussed at all by
men of business, it is surely time to dismiss this
alleged safeguard of a certificate. It can never, as
we have shown, be of the least avail in reference to
skill; and as a real preventive it must equally prove
nugatory in regard to moral conduct. Without
intending any disrespect, it must be pronounced
to savour a little of the ludicrous.</p>

<p>Let us suppose some measure introduced into
one of the counties of England, affecting its population
as vitally as compulsory manumission affects
the slaves in our colonies, and what would be
thought of any person who should gravely propose,
that a public officer, amid other multifarious duties,
should certify minutely as to the individual character
of every man in the county? If we were to
circumscribe his jurisdiction to a few square miles,
or even to a few streets of one town, the thing
must plainly be impossible.</p>

<p>Dissimulation, hypocrisy, and craft, are often described
as the parents of crime, and they will be inevitably
resorted to, to screen the vices of the slave.
His maxim will be, Let me become a vicious subject,
to lower my value with my master, and let me become
an adept in cunning to deceive the protector.</p>

<p>The higher his intellectual attainments, the easier
will it be for him to practise this deception with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
success; and while, as has been shown in the preceding
section, the beneficial attributes of future
civilisation are checked, the slave is habituated to
its corruptions.</p>

<p>None of the palliators of the measure can get over
this conclusion, that if flagrant crime be not openly
encouraged, it cannot be denied that it is fostered
secretly. How many will be the plans laid for
stealing in the dark; and for this evil there is no
cure. If the delinquent be detected, it depreciates
his character, and, consequently, his value; and,
if undiscovered, it swells the fund which is to make
him free.</p>


<h3><i>Section 3.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">VIRTUOUS UNION OF THE SEXES IMPEDED.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">If we wish to infuse a higher sense of moral feeling
among the slaves, it is indispensable to elevate their
ideas in regard to the virtuous union of the sexes.
There is no one of the measures of amelioration
which has attracted more attention, or which is
more desired by the British community.</p>

<p>We often hear that there is too great a temptation
to immorality in this particular among the colonists.
It may undoubtedly be true; but still illicit connexions
are materially checked by the dread of
bringing into existence an offspring whose lot by
birth would be slavery.</p>

<p>If compulsory manumission be enforced, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
salutary barrier is removed, because the freedom of
any female slave could be purchased by the person
desirous of cohabiting with her, and her offspring
would be free. Thus, on the parties colluding to
take advantage of the new measure, the greatest
mischiefs would accrue to the community.</p>

<p>If this practice once obtained, and were found
easy of accomplishment, the female slaves would
have a powerful inducement to court illicit connexion
with the whites, in preference to marriage
with men of their own condition. One of the chief
objects of amelioration would thus be frustrated,
and the offspring of these connexions become liable
to be left destitute in case of the sickness, absence,
or death of the father, and consequently thrown
upon the casual charity of the public.</p>

<p>Besides the immorality thus in the first instance
produced, how fruitful a source of future crime is

<h3><i>Section 4.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">TASK-WORK PREVENTED.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">When we examine the measure as it will more
immediately affect the domestic government of each
plantation, we find objections equally forcible with
those already stated.</p>

<p>In none of Mr. Canning’s orations on the subject
has he been so eloquent as when he described the
effect of abolishing impending coercion, upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
feelings of the slave. He depicted in the most
powerful manner the beautiful effects that would
ensue when the slave performed his work with
alacrity, and his condition assimilated to that of
the voluntary labourer. It was here that he expatiated
upon the wisdom of allowing benefits to the
slave to flow from the master, since it would incite
them to work without the necessity for coercion. The
system of task-work would be introduced, which
perhaps is the greatest practical improvement in
the condition of slavery.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that this system can only
exist with the agreement and reciprocal feeling of
both parties. The slave knows well that his master
can return to the old system at his will, and this
reflection is the chief cause for establishing the improvement.
The master knows well, that the law
empowers him to keep his slaves at work till six
in the evening; but he considers that, if he can
elicit their spontaneous skill and assiduity, they
will get through an equal quantity of work by an
earlier hour, and will pursue their labour cheerfully.
He is therefore disposed to approve of task-work
wherever it is practicable, both under the influence
of that more humane spirit which pervades the
colonies, and from the desire to save himself the
trouble and expense of superintendence in the
field.</p>

<p>Under this beneficial regulation, the negroes are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
found to complete their day’s work by as early an
hour as three or four o’clock, having then the
remainder of the day at their own disposal, to
earn money for themselves. The master never
thinks of objecting to such earnings, which benefit
his people without injuring himself. On the contrary,
it is to his advantage, by increasing their
contentment, the salutary operation of which we
have described in a preceding section.</p>

<p>But let compulsory manumission be insisted on,
and how differently will he then contemplate the
earnings of his slaves! At present their little funds
are spent in harmless amusements—in adorning
their persons, and giving Christmas and other holiday
entertainments, in which it is their delight to
mimic the manners of the whites. But change
the scene, and let them employ their earnings to
procure their freedom, and what will be the
master’s course? He will be constrained, in self-defence
to stop their means of earning. He will
discontinue task-work, and keep his negroes working
until six o’clock, as the law allows him.</p>

<p>Let us banish Utopian views from our thoughts,
and consider, as practical men, is it ever to be
expected—is it reasonable, that colonial proprietors
would act otherwise? You drive them to it. They
have vested their property on the express declaration
of the law, that they are entitled to the labour
of their slaves until <em>six o’clock</em>. You cannot change
this hour for an earlier one, without infringing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
rights of property, in a manner which could never
possibly be contemplated by any legislature. There
is therefore no regulation which can obviate the evil.
Task-work, consisting of a multiplicity of details,
cannot in its very nature be commanded or enforced
by any other authority than that of the master.
Its beneficial effects upon the slaves consist in the
master’s entering into their feelings, and giving
them encouragement precisely in the degree that
personal trouble in management is removed.</p>

<p>When property in slaves is made but a precarious
interest, dependent upon the slaves themselves, it
is no more than the truth to assert, that a rigorous
system of coercion, such as prevailed in the colonies
some twenty years ago, would return.</p>

<p>If it be argued, that this involves a contradiction
in reference to the <em>contentment</em>, described as being
the proprietor’s chief object to establish, let it be
recollected that he is now in a dilemma. If he
allows his slaves to accumulate earnings, they may
be employed to his own <em>total ruin</em>; he has therefore
to get, as speedily as possible, the utmost degree
of work from his labourers that the law allows him.</p>


<h3><i>Section 5.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">INVIDIOUS FEELINGS EXCITED BY PROMPTING TO A
GENERAL RUSH FOR FREEDOM.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">Several of His Majesty’s ministers, in various
declarations and speeches, have alluded to the
institution of slavery in ancient times; and availing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
themselves of the great experience thus presented
for guidance and direction, have affirmed that the
same measures of amelioration should be introduced
to mitigate slavery in the West India colonies,
which had in times past mitigated slavery in
Europe. By obvious analogy, if the experience
of times past be the true guide in measures relating
to amelioration, the same experience should be
the guide for measures relating to emancipation.</p>

<p>Let us examine, then, if this be the case.</p>

<p>In all ages and records of history, and in every
nation on the globe in which slavery has existed,
the difficulties of manumission have become less
and less as civilisation advanced. But by the mode
of operation laid down by Lord Bathurst, the difficulties
in the present case must gradually increase.
In a gang of one hundred negroes, the first man
applying for freedom would have his relative utility
to the plantation estimated at a small sum, the loss
of the services of an individual not materially impeding
its cultivation. But if thirty or forty men
were to be abstracted from the estate, the sum to
be assessed as relative utility must rise in a rapidly
increased ratio, the remaining hands being wholly
incompetent to render the fixed capital productive.</p>

<p>Supposing, then, the measure to possess an executory
principle: in the first year, according to its
projectors, a man might procure his freedom at 100<i>l.</i>
At the end of the second year, a man of precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
the same capabilities and abstract value would find
the price of manumission risen to 150<i>l.</i> At the
end of the third year it might rise to 200<i>l.</i>; and
so on, progressively, until it mounted to 500<i>l.</i>, or
a still higher sum.</p>

<p>This is the operation consequent on the terms employed
by Earl Bathurst, and subsequently, indeed,
explicitly avowed by him, to illustrate the measure.</p>

<p>It has been considered, and repeatedly declared
by His Majesty’s ministers, that a progressive
amelioration in the condition of the slaves, the
diffusion of moral instruction, the just appreciation
of the blessings of a pure religion, and a gradual
reformation in manners and opinions, should continue
to exercise their salutary influence, until
slavery insensibly glided into freedom.</p>

<p>Yet compulsory manumission proceeds in express
contradiction to this principle. It teaches the slave,
that the sooner he demands his freedom the easier
it will be for him to succeed. It discourages the
idea of delaying till the morals be improved by
instruction, and it urges him to rush forward at once
by the most expeditious course, by teaching him,
that those only who delay incur the danger of disappointment.</p>

<p>The public at large have been harangued about
the <em>gradual operation</em> of the measure. What will
be their surprise when they understand, that the
meaning of such gradual operation simply is, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the difficulties in attaining the object sought should
become greater by degrees instead of less? It is,
indeed, a notable specimen of legislation, to announce
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: to theslaves">to the slaves</ins>,—Now that you are ignorant,
you may procure your freedom for 100<i>l.</i>; but some
years hence, when you have improved by instruction,
you will have to pay five times as much.</p>

<p>Under such excitements, a measure which works
on the predominant passions of men, awakening
in them mutual feelings of envy and distrust,
prompting each to take advantage of his fellow,
and universally forestalling the fruits of civilisation,
must be utterly incompatible with the well-being of
the slave.</p>

<p>Who, therefore, can maintain, all the circumstances
enumerated in the foregoing sections taken
in conjunction, that compulsory manumission is in
conformity with the Resolution of Parliament?</p>

</div>

<p class="center fs110">SAFETY OF THE COLONIES ENDANGERED.</p>


<p class="p2 noindent">The correspondence of Mr. Canning with Mr.
Galatin, lately published, evinces plainly the importance
which is attached to our transatlantic possessions.
It cannot be supposed that a minister of
state will hold one tone to a foreign power, and a
different one to ourselves.</p>

<p>It is on occasions of public diplomacy, when our
own policy is opposed to that of the great rising
republic of America, that the full swell of public
opinion makes known the extent of interest felt by
the British nation towards her colonies.</p>

<p>The love of dominion is natural to mankind, and
few like to lose what they have once possessed;
but, with the reflecting part of the nation, this
feeling is strengthened by the consciousness that
slavery itself will be promoted by the destruction
of the British colonies. Foreign nations will take
up what we abandon; and if we are still to consume
sugar, the state of the continental markets
proves to a demonstration that that consumption
will be supplied by slave-labour, and not by free
labour from either east or west.</p>

<p>Hence the safety of the colonies not only affects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
the dignity of His Majesty’s crown, which ministers
have sworn to uphold; but it combines every consideration
on this question which can influence the
conduct of an independent member of the legislature.</p>

<p>If, then, there ever was a measure which involved
a dilemma, it is that of compulsory manumission.
It must either be operative, or, from the restrictions
with which it is fenced, it must be inoperative.</p>

<p>Let us view it in both ways.</p>


<h3><i>Section 1.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">CULTIVATION SUPERSEDED.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">It is almost unnecessary to remark, that the nature
of the colonial system assumes the production in the
colonies of commodities possessing exchangeable
value, to be transported to the mother-country for
sale, and tending, in the various relations of their
transport, to promote and invigorate the national
commerce.</p>

<p>But if the negroes free themselves in the manner
proposed, this commerce must cease.</p>

<p>The writer of the “Remarks” has made one acknowledgment
which greatly abridges the necessity
for argument or examination on this head. He says,
that no instance has yet occurred of free negroes
working steadily for hire in the field, in the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
colonies; and that it is not to be expected that
they will so work, until their physical wants have
been augmented.</p>

<p>Now it has been shown, in the <a href="#ch4sect1">first section of
the preceding chapter</a>, that those wants, instead of
being augmented, or even established, are effectually
checked by the new measure. If there could be,
in the first instance, a hope that cultivation might
hereafter be conducted by free labourers, it is
destroyed in its bud; and precisely in the degree
that the negroes are freed, will the value of the
colonies decline.</p>

<p>Political economy is now the fashion. All who
are connected with the Legislature, or who take a
part in public affairs, are anxious to display their
proficiency in this science. Without further comment,
an appeal is made to them to pronounce,
on weighing well the reasoning referred to, if profitable
cultivation in the colonies will not be superseded.</p>

<p>What, then, would be the object of protecting
those colonies? They would virtually be lost to
this country, in express contradiction to the declared
policy of the Legislature.</p>


<h3><i>Section 2.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">REBELLION INSTIGATED.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">On the other hand, let us suppose compulsory
manumission inoperative; that Government discover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
its latent difficulties, and that they wish ostensibly
to enforce its enactment while they fetter it with
restrictions to prevent its practical working.</p>

<p>Here it is conceived that still more disastrous
consequences would ensue. You tell the negro that
he has a right to purchase his freedom; and when
he comes forward to claim it, he finds himself mocked
and imposed upon.</p>

<p>In common reason, is this the kind of legislation
we are to expect after the many warnings we have
had of negro-susceptibility, and the well-grounded
conviction that there are embers, only wanting one
kindling breath to involve the whole colonies in
destruction?</p>

<p>Since the agitation of negro-emancipation, within
these few years past, a great excitement has prevailed
among the slaves, and mischief on no common
scale has occurred, merely from the delusion
practised upon the negroes as to the pretended
benefits intended them. During the insurrection
in Demerara, when the insurgents were told by the
governor, of the new laws and indulgences to be
granted them, they received the boon with comparative
derision; they said, to quote the words of
the Governor’s despatch, that “those things were
no comforts for them; that they were tired of
being slaves; that their good King had sent orders
that they should be free, and that they would not
work any more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<p>By obvious analogy we may judge of the danger
if an inoperative law be now passed. To inspire
hopes which can never be realized, is at any time
bad; but in the case of the slaves, it is to render
them for ever dissatisfied with their lot, and to
arouse every angry passion in their minds. The
strongest indignation, therefore, should be expressed
at attempts made to palliate the manifold errors of
the measure, or to procure the unreflecting concurrence
of parties locally interested, by representing
that it might ostensibly be allowed to pass, if
rendered inoperative, because then no harm can
result from it. Such a mode of proceeding to all
parties concerned, both master and slave, would be
unworthy of the British Government, and not more
disingenuous than impolitic.</p>

<p>Imagine, for a moment, the feelings of a slave,
who, relying upon the efficacy of the law promulgated,
applies for his freedom, but finds all a
fallacy! Think of his baffled hope—the pinings
of the heart—the burning sense of injustice! And
it is all-important to reflect, that the obnoxious
object of these excited passions will be the master,
or the resident proprietor. The negro will never
believe that he has been deceived by the King of
England. He will decide, that the King has conferred
on him the boon, and that it has been intercepted
by combination of the colonial proprietors.</p>

<p>The negroes are just beginning to be sensible
that amelioration is different from what they first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
imagined it. Proclamations and proceedings of
the governors have tended to check their fatal impression
that a life of idleness was now at hand;
but if you disturb the existing tranquillity, if you
again raise the delusive cry of “Freedom!” may
we not apprehend that kindred spirits, brooding
over their fancied wrongs, will coalesce, and discontent
thus swell into rebellion. It is vain to
disguise or cloak the measure. Every colonial
proprietor knows the excitement that will always
be kept up by the anti-colonial party. “If I am
to be robbed,” he will say, “rather let me suffer
at once, than be kept in perpetual dread of ruin.
If a slave worth 300<i>l.</i> comes to demand his freedom,
better suffer a loss of 100<i>l.</i> than send him
back with a refusal, for assuredly he will never
be a peaceable or good subject again.” In his own
defence, therefore, he must refuse to sanction any
modifications of a measure which will equally injure
himself, and endanger the public safety.</p>

<p>Whether, then, compulsory manumission contain
an executory principle, or otherwise, it is
incompatible with the safety of the colonies.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We have now contemplated the measure in every
point of view, and it must be emphatically pronounced
to be contrary both to the letter and the
spirit of the Resolutions of both houses of Parliament.</p>

</div>

<p class="center fs110">NO JUST ANALOGY IN THE PRECEDENTS ADDUCED BY GOVERNMENT.</p>


<p class="p2 noindent">A thousand precedents would never justify a bad
measure—it may therefore be deemed superfluous
to offer a remark on this head; but as Mr. Canning
has argued, that whatever is adopted in one colony
can safely be introduced into all the rest, and as
this maxim has been taken for granted by many
persons willing to save themselves the trouble of
thinking, it is necessary to enter into some explanation.</p>


<h3><i>Section 1.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">TRINIDAD.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">When the order in council for negro treatment
was sent out to Trinidad, great objections were
offered, both generally, and to the individual clauses
which constitute compulsory manumission.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to inquire how often that
order has been altered, or the reasons why the
colonists of Trinidad have been constrained to
submit to the authority imposed upon them. We
have only to show that the case of that island differs
from that of the other British colonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<p>Trinidad was originally a Spanish colony; its
laws were framed previously to the abolition of the
slave-trade, and have continued unaltered since the
cession of the island to Great Britain.</p>

<p>Now it is apparent that, when fresh slaves can be
procured, compulsory manumission is not so objectionable;
because the place of those who purchase
their freedom can be immediately filled up by
others.</p>

<p>It has consequently been considered that, while
the slave-trade was in active operation in the
Spanish colonies, the practice of manumission was
encouraged, as increasing the means of preventing
insurrection.</p>

<p>But it is surely unfair to hold up to the imitation
of another colony the enactments and usages introduced
by one whose laws were adapted to a state
of things so different; and to require that the provisions
of a code adapted to the existence of the
slave-trade, should be engrafted upon other codes
framed since its abolition.</p>

<p>The order in council for Trinidad has not affected
the principle of the Spanish law, or rather the practice
in the Spanish colonies, which allows a slave to
enfranchise himself by purchase. But the British law
in our settlements gives no such right whatever to a
slave.</p>

<p>According to those codes, the interest of an
owner in his slave is that of a fee-simple absolute:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
he purchased upon that tenure, he has continued to
hold upon the same, and cannot be deprived of
that legal title without a direct violation of property.</p>

<p>In Trinidad it is otherwise: a person purchasing
a slave in that colony, knows beforehand that he
acquires only a precarious title in such a slave,
which depends on the ability of the slave to purchase
himself.</p>

<p>Nor has sufficient time yet elapsed to make
known the great difference in the working of the
measure that must take place now that the slave-trade
has ceased, contrasted with the period when
it was in active prosecution.</p>

<p>It ought also to be stated, that the hardship and
evils of the law in Trinidad, even subsequent to the
abolition of the slave-trade, had not been so much
felt, from the nature of its laws not being generally
known in this country: consequently, there was
no extraneous excitement upon the subject given to
the minds of the negroes.</p>

<p>But now, when this excitement has been given,
the brief experience already afforded, tends strongly
to corroborate the arguments we have advanced;
and it is credibly asserted, that the Secretary for
the Colonies has received representations and appeals,
proving evils to have proceeded from the
operation of this law.</p>

<p>Among these evils, theft is shown to have increased;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
and the proceedings before the local
magistrates are said to evince a progressive demoralization
amongst the negroes.</p>

<p>It is further known, that instances have occurred
where the sum assessed by the appraisers, as the
price of manumission, has been higher than the
negro was able, or considered himself entitled, to
pay; and the being sent back under these circumstances
has visibly produced in him a sullenness
and discontent exactly as has been described, and
in all probability as injurious to the interests of his
master, as if he had obtained his discharge at his
own valuation.</p>

<p>From these circumstances, it is apparent that
there is no analogy between the case of Trinidad
and that of the other British Colonies, and that
thus far no proper precedent is established.</p>


<h3><i>Section 2.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">ST. LUCIE.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">In regard to this colony, the measure has been but
recently introduced, and without the spontaneous
concurrence of its inhabitants. It was established
there by the force of arbitrary authority. There
was no adequate court or power, similar in constitution
and functions to the Assemblies in the other
islands, to resist its promulgation; and the threat
conveyed in the despatch of Earl Bathurst to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
Governor, thus amounted to an imperative mandate
for the adoption of the measure as law in the colony.</p>

<p>Is this a precedent?</p>


<h3><i>Section 3.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">BERBICE.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">The case of Berbice is still more flagrant. This
colony possessed, a short time back, a council
composed of persons having property at stake.
Before the enactments relating to the slaves in that
colony were brought forward, this council was dismissed,
and another arbitrarily appointed, consisting
of persons having no interest in the cultivation
of the colony.</p>

<p>It was previously declared, that the new laws
relating to the slaves, in whatever way they might
be finally settled, should not be carried into operation
at Berbice, unless the same measures were at
the same time adopted in Demerara. In the latter
colony, all the measures relating to amelioration
were received, and compulsory manumission alone
rejected; but in Berbice, the new council, so appointed
and so composed, passed the latter measure
contrary to the wish of every proprietor in the
colony.</p>

<p>It ought moreover to be stated that, before the
new laws were promulgated in Demerara, they
were sent home to Lord Bathurst for confirmation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
upon which his Lordship observes,—“The
King has been graciously pleased to approve
the decision that you adopted, of referring the
draft of the Act to his Majesty, for his consideration,
instead of immediately promulgating it as a
law in the colony.”</p>

<p>But how does the new Council of Berbice act?
The most important of all the new measures they
carry at once into effect; that is to say, they allow
no opportunity for parties in England to carry
remonstrance or explanation to the foot of the
throne.</p>

<p>Again, let us ask, is this a precedent? What is
the meaning of the term? does it not warrant the
inference, in this case, that some assembly, composed
of parties interested, have given their concurrence?
But how marked is the difference
between a council composed of persons possessing
little or no property in slaves, and a court where
several of the members hold large plantations, and
are deeply interested in the permanent prosperity
of their colony.</p>

<p>The possession of this large stake by the members,
and the circumstance of having delegated
interests to represent, peculiarly conduce to safe
and practicable legislation. Such circumstances
present a security against precipitancy,—prompt
to a careful and minute consideration of all local
peculiarities,—and procure for every public measure
a full and patient examination of all its relations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
both direct and contingent, before it is permitted
to be put in execution.</p>

<p>And further, in respect to any one of these West India
cases, has there elapsed a time sufficient to
enable us to estimate the policy of the experiment,
and still less to pronounce upon its fitness for the
whole of our West Indian possessions?</p>


<h3><i>Section 4.</i><br>
<span class="fs70">CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</span></h3>

<p class="p1 noindent">How this colony should be referred to as a precedent
it is difficult to explain. Its climate differs
materially from that of the West Indies. In the
latter, the evils apprehended from giving freedom
to the slaves arise from the impossibility of procuring
free labourers to supply their place. It is
but a very short time since emigration from this
country to the Cape of Good Hope was greatly
encouraged; and it is ascertained, by experience,
that Europeans can work without injury or inconvenience
in that climate.</p>

<p>Thus the supply of voluntary labourers not only
existing, but increasing in that colony, the inducements
to perpetuate slavery must progressively
expire, and slaves may consequently be freed
without injury to the property of their owners, or
danger to the public safety.</p>

<p>From this obvious difference in physical circumstances
between the West India colonies and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Cape of Good Hope, there is no just analogy between
the two; and though compulsory manumission
may be enacted in the one, it cannot, therefore,
be taken as a model for imitation to the other.</p>

<p>This straining after inapplicable precedent clearly
indicates deficiency of argument.</p>

<p>No enactment containing inherently a principle
of evil, even though acceded to willingly, or acquiesced
in passively, by individual bodies, should
ever be set up by a wise government as an example
for general adoption.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It has been more than once remarked in Parliament,
by persons of high character, that the precedent
generally existing throughout the Spanish colonies
served as a sufficient ground for the measure.</p>

<p>But there are two points which should never be
omitted in reflecting on the question:</p>

<p>I. As to the opportunity of procuring other labourers.</p>

<p>II. The difference of amount sunk in fixed capital,
between the Spanish colonies and those of
Great Britain.</p>

<p>In regard to the first, fresh labourers can be
procured in the Spanish colonies, but cannot in the
British; and in regard to the second, there must
surely be some difference in the working of a measure
when the amount of capital to be withdrawn
varies in the proportion of 20,000<i>l.</i> in the one case,
to a few hundreds in the other.</p>

<p class="center fs110">RESPONSIBILITY ATTACHING TO MINISTERS IF
THEY ENFORCE COMPULSORY MANUMISSION.</p>


<p class="p2 noindent">Whoever notices the levity of manner with which
this question is treated, would imagine that our
constitution had undergone a change, and that His
Majesty’s advisers were relieved from responsibility
for the acts of the executive. On any occasion it
is a rash step to counsel the crown to important
measures before a full investigation has been instituted.
But when a step is taken so contrary to the
laws of the realm, as, by eminent law-authorities,
Compulsory Manumission, in regard to mortgaged
property, is conceived to be, <em>responsibility</em> ceases
to be an idle term, and circumstances may arise
from it to disturb the peace of a minister of state
much longer than he anticipates.</p>

<p>It can never be too often repeated that, so far as
legislation for the negroes is concerned, what is
once done is irrevocable. In other public measures,
an opportunity is afforded to a minister, when he
makes a false step, to change his policy by a dexterous
manœuvre. But no such resource being
afforded in the West India Question, we should
conclude that more cautious deliberation would in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
the first instance be exercised, and that a <em>full examination</em>
would take place before excitement was
created by announcing even the heads of a new
measure. The proceedings hitherto have been on
a principle directly opposite. While the Irish
Question remains undecided, though more than a
generation has passed by since it commenced; and
while the Corn Question has stood over until argument
on the subject is exhausted: In the West
India Question—where, wrong measures being
once taken, all remedy is hopeless—the parties
whose whole property is at stake cannot be allowed
more than the lapse of a few weeks, to put
on record all their objections to the most essential
innovations.</p>

<p>This presents an anomaly in the history of public
measures, and it can only be accounted for by
supposing that ministers, amid their many duties,
have completely undervalued the importance of
the measure now pending. This conclusion is
confirmed by what is understood to be their language
to independent members of the legislature
whose suffrage they solicit in future discussion.
They say the principal opposition of the West
Indians is no more than idle and transient clamour.
It is merely of a piece with what has been always
witnessed. When the abolition of the slave-trade
was under discussion, did we not hear the cry, that
our ancient colonies would be ruined? That great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
measure was carried, yet no ruin ensued. When
the Registry Bill was brought in, had we not a
similar clamour, that the most dangerous excitement
among the slaves would be the consequence?
That point, too, was carried; yet no such direful
evils attended it. Again, when the recent Amelioration
Clauses were proposed, how furious was
the opposition in the colonies,—the proprietors
there were to be utterly ruined. Many of these
clauses have since been enacted, even where opposition
was strongest at the first, and yet no
injury or change has taken place! What is the
inference in regard to compulsory manumission?
We have strenuous opposition at present, it is
true; but when the measure is once carried, that
will soon subside, and all the frightful features of
danger which have alarmed the colonists will turn
out to be mere phantoms of the imagination.</p>

<p>Now, in answer, may we not allege, in the first
place, that the objections urged against those former
measures were not groundless. Our abolition of
the slave-trade, without securing the effectual concurrence
of foreign powers in a similar act, has
transferred from British to foreign colonies the
principal supply of Europe with sugar, and without
the smallest benefit to Africa. The Registry Bills
are an enormous tax on our impoverished colonies,
and it is not to them we owe the extinction of our
colonial slave-trade. Of our recent Amelioration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Clauses, the effect in diminishing production is as
yet more certain than that of increased benefit to
the negro-population.</p>

<p>In the second place, may we not pronounce that
the case we are now submitting is very different
from any of those cited?</p>

<p>But in this age of superficiality, where all laborious
investigation seems exploded, and when a
well-turned period of declamation in Parliament
sways the nation, let us take another mode of
pointing out the difference of this case.</p>

<p>In those important measures which were passed
some time back, the Government carried a great
number of colonial proprietors living in this country
along with them. How different, then, on <i lang="la">primâ
facie</i> evidence, must be the nature and bearings of
the measure now proposed, when colonial proprietors,
who have always acted with ministers, are
constrained, as a solemn duty in defence of their
properties and of their families, to oppose it strenuously!
It is evident, that to occasion such a feeling,
there must be something in the measure
alarmingly important, and demanding the most
cautious scrutiny.</p>

<p>In former times, the letters sent out by colonial
proprietors in England to their friends in the colonies
impressed upon the latter, to do all that they were
able, to silence clamour in England; but with regard
to compulsory manumission, the lesser evil is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
chosen, and the admonition is, “Beware of passing
this measure, and thus committing yourselves by
your own act. <em>Throw all the responsibility upon
ministers, that you may hereafter have full claims
for indemnification.</em>”</p>

<p>The question then resolves itself into this,—Are
ministers, considering the situation in which they
are placed, and having a due regard to their own
fame, prepared to take this responsibility upon
themselves? Do they rely upon the passing
opinions of the day for their support? Lord
Bathurst says, in his despatches, that the colonial
legislature “may be assured, that from the final
accomplishment of this object this country will
not be diverted.”</p>

<p>Now it may be true that, with the unthinking
populace, the extinction of slavery is desired; but
what practical statesman would take this vague
expression of feeling for his guide? It may safely be
affirmed, that the intelligent portion of the community
are aware of the difficulties, and expect from
Government, not what is theoretically to be desired,
but what is practically and wisely attainable.
They are not prepared to lose our West India
colonies, which are believed to contribute largely
to the prosperity and strength of the kingdom; nor
are they at all disposed to inflict injustice upon
their fellow-subjects, knowing well, that whatever
odium may now attach to the colonial proprietor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
the charge of having countenanced slavery is one
which he shares with the whole British nation.</p>

<p>But it ought further to be known, and well reflected
on by His Majesty’s ministers, that humane
and enlightened individuals, not anxious for the political
so much as the moral grandeur of the country,
who waive every notion of expediency, and consider
the cause of humanity as paramount, are beginning
to entertain doubts as to the wisdom of the proceedings
of Government.</p>

<p>This is not vague opinion, but is founded on
weighty reasons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First</span>: That it is the object of British humanity
to exalt the entire African race, and to accomplish
it as a matter of genuine philanthropy in the most
general and efficient manner.</p>

<p>It appears by parliamentary documents, that as
cultivation, during some years past, has decreased
in the British colonies, precisely in the same degree
has the slave-trade of foreigners increased.</p>

<p>To ruin or deteriorate the British colonies is thus
to encourage the horrors of the slave-trade, and to
increase the sum of African suffering.</p>

<p>Therefore, it being the object of the British
nation to abridge that suffering, and not to make a
mere display of sensibility, if the proposed measures
can be proved to be destructive of cultivation
in the British colonies, their spirit must be pronounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
to be contrary to the sentiments of the
country.</p>

<p>And, <span class="smcap">Secondly</span>: That having long since committed
the crime of transporting the negroes to our
West India colonies, it is expected by the British
nation, that the welfare of future generations will
be contemplated; and that, hereafter, a black
society may be witnessed, possessing in itself the
attributes, moral, intellectual, and political, of a
civilized people.</p>

<p>So strongly does this sentiment pervade the
nation, that it is common to hear the inquiry—“What
are the negroes to do when free?” implying
the belief that rash interference may have proceeded
far to accomplish the object, but that judicious legislation
has stopped short on the threshold.</p>

<p>If we were to make an appeal to Lord Bathurst,
and to all who have taken an active part in the
promotion of compulsory manumission, must they
not acknowledge, that since the agitation of the
subject in 1823, a considerable and perceptible
change has taken place in public opinion, in consequence
of the inquiry relative to free labour; and
that the idea of having a free negro-peasantry
labouring under a tropical climate for hire is impracticable
and hopeless.</p>

<p>Does not, then, the whole question depend on
free labour?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<p>We cannot but infer, that when the relations and
consequences of granting freedom to the negroes
by compulsion are fully understood in all their
widely-spreading effects, the opinion of the country
will be as strongly expressed in reprobation, as
Earl Bathurst pronounces it at present to be in approbation
of the speedy adoption of the measure.</p>

<p>Without any disrespect it may be stated, that
some of our ministers, who are upborne by the
current of public applause, have had sufficient experience
of the fickleness of popularity. Let us
recall to mind the wise precept of Mr. Canning
in 1819—“Speak not the <em>will</em> of the populace,
but consult their <em>benefit</em>.”</p>

<p>We appeal to each member of parliament to
further this counsel. The question of negro-<em>emancipation</em>
is virtually before them. It is conceived,
by all those whose properties are at stake, to be
presented in its most objectionable form, and they
unanimously oppose it. Before deciding on the
subject, let every member reflect on the sentiments
of two of our greatest statesmen.</p>

<p>Mr. Pitt, in every discussion in which negro-emancipation
was agitated, pronounced, that it was
an act which must “flow from the master alone.”</p>

<p>When that presiding genius of the country’s commercial
greatness was no more—when Mr. Fox
had coalesced with Lord Grenville,—and above all,
when the whole anti-colonial party, with Mr. Wilberforce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
at its head, had joined his ranks, Mr.
Fox, in the full tide of his popularity and his power,
declared—</p>

<p>“That the idea of an act of parliament to emancipate
the slaves in the West Indies, <em>without the
consent and concurrent feeling of all parties concerned</em>,
<span class="allsmcap">BOTH IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THAT</span>, would
not only be mischievous in its consequences, but
totally extravagant in its conception, as well as
impracticable in its execution.”</p>
